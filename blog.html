                    <h2>About Web Development</h2>
                    <p>Web development encompasses a broad range of tasks, from coding and technical design to the performance of a website or application running on the internet. It involves building and maintaining websites, applications, and intranets, using various programming languages, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                        Components of Web Development
                        Front-end Development: Focuses on the user interface (UI) and look-and-feel of the website or application, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                        Back-end Development: Concerned with the server-side logic, databases, APIs, and server configuration, using languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, and Java.
                        Types of Web Development
                        Front-end Development: Specializes in client-side scripting and UI/UX design.
                        Back-end Development: Focuses on server-side programming and database management.
                        Full-stack Development: Involves working on both front-end and back-end aspects of web development.</p>

                    <h2>How to start Web dev</h2>
                    <p>The best first step to becoming a Web Developer is to start learning web development fundamentals, including an understanding of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript.

                        Many aspiring Web Developers are now using coding bootcamps to fast-track the learning process. 
                        Coding bootcamps have thrived because they are short, immersive, and focused on outcomes and employment â€“ 
                        their goal is to develop job-ready skills as efficiently as possible, making them an increasingly worthwhile investment for a would-be Web Developer. According to the job site Indeed, four out of five companies in the U.S. have hired a graduate from a coding bootcamp.</p>

                    <h2>Importance of Video games</h2>
                    <p>The videogame industry lost its innocence a long time ago. These days, it's a mature sector, admired for its technological muscle, innovative capacity and its well-developed entrepreneurial vision. The figures don't lie: the sector ended 2022 with global income of more than $180 billion and a forecast that this number will exceed $200 billion in 2025, according to market intelligence company Newzoo.

                        With numbers like this, it's no surprise that videogames dominate the audio-visual sector, far ahead of music and cinema. Not even Hollywood can compete with a sector that boasts 3.2 billion players in the world, particularly with hits like Fortnite, which has more than 230 million monthly active players. The fever for this videogame has crossed borders and is already rattling giants like Netflix more than Disney and HBO, 
                        its direct competitors in the battle to dominate the audio-visual content streaming field.</p>
